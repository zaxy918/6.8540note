# Preparation

- **Work flow of mapreduce system**
	1. There will be one coordinator (master) and multiple workers (M map-workers and R reduce-workers). The coordinator picks idle workers and assigns each one a map task or a reduce task.
	2. A worker who is assigned a map task reads the contents of the corresponding input split. It parses key/value pairs out of the input data and passes each pair to the user-defined Map function. The intermediate key/value pairs produced by the Map function are buffered in memory.
	3. Periodically, the buffered pairs are written to local disk (temp files in the lab), partitioned into R regions (*with file name of mr-X-Y, which X is the map task number and Y is the reduce task number*) by the partitioning function. The locations of these buffered pairs on the local disk are passed back to the master, who is responsible for forwarding these locations to the reduce workers.
	4. When a reduce-worker is notified (*in the lab we notify the reduce-workers after all map-workers are done*) by the master about these locations, it uses *RPC* to read the buffered data from the local disks of the map-workers. When a reduce-worker has read all intermediate data, it sorts it by the intermediate keys so that all occurrences of the same key are grouped together. The sorting is needed because typically many different keys map to the same reduce task. If the amount of intermediate data is too large to fit in memory, an external sort is used.
	5. The reduce worker iterates over the sorted intermediate data and for each unique intermediate key encountered, it passes the key and the corresponding set of intermediate values to the user’s Reduce function. The output of the Reduce function is appended to a final output file for this reduce partition (*with the file name of mr-out-Y*).
	6. When all map tasks and reduce tasks have been completed, the master wakes up the user program. At this point, the MapReduce call in the user program returns back to the user code.

# Working

## Structure
As the hints say, I start at the Worker() function in mr/worker.go. I first structured the Worker().
```go
// main/mrworker.go calls this function.
func Worker(sockname string, mapf func(string, string) []KeyValue,
	reducef func(string, []string) string) {

	coordSockName = sockname
	args := WorkerArgs{Status: Wait, IsFirstCall: true}
	// Waiting for the coordinator to assign tasks
	for {
		reply := WorkerReply{}
		ok := call("Coordinator.Assign", &args, &reply)
		if reply.Status == Wait {
			time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 50)
			continue
		}
		if !ok {
			log.Fatalf("RPC call failure")
		} else {
			switch reply.Status {
			case MapTask:
				//TODO
			case ReduceTask:
				//TODO
			case Exit:
				os.Exit(0)
			}
		}
	}
}
```
Then I designed the WorkerArgs() and WorkerReply() in mr/rpc.go.
```go
type Status int

const (
	MapTask Status = iota
	ReduceTask
	Wait
	MapDone
	ReduceDone
	Exit
)

// Worker RPC args
type WorkerArgs struct {
	Status         Status
	IsFirstCall    bool
	InterFileNames []string
	WorkerId       int
}

// Worker RPC reply
type WorkerReply struct {
	Status   Status
	WorkerId int
	TaskId   int
	Files    []string
	NReduce  int
}
```
Here the WorkerId is assigned when a worker first do the remote procedure call. The TaskId is assigned when the worker was assigned to a map or reduce job.

> [!note] Note
> My first design was not like this. At that time I didn't take the fault tolerance into consideration. So I only define the TaskId.

Then here is the Assign() function in mr/coordinator.go. 
```go
func (c *Coordinator) Assign(args *WorkerArgs, reply *WorkerReply) error {
	c.mu.Lock()
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	if args.IsFirstCall {
		//TODO
	}
	switch args.status {
	case Wait:
		//TODO
	case MapDone:
		//TODO
	case ReduceDone:
		//TODO
	default:
		return errors.New("invalid task status")
	}
	return nil
}
```

## Map Task

The basic structure of Mapreduce is defined now, so I continue my work in the MapTask case in Worker()
```go
func Worker(sockname string, mapf func(string, string) []KeyValue,reducef func(string, []string) string) {
...
	case MapTask:
		slog.Debug("Start map task", "worker_id", reply.WorkerId, "task_id", reply.TaskId)
		// Iterate all files
		kvs := []KeyValue{}
		for _, filename := range files {
			content, err := os.ReadFile(filename)
			if err != nil {
				log.Fatalf("Read file fail: %v", filename)
				args = WorkerArgs{Status: Wait}
				continue
			}
			kvs = append(kvs, mapf(filename, string(content))...)
		}
		// Generate temporary file for reduce worker
		interFileNames := writeIntermediate(kvs, reply.TaskId)
		args = WorkerArgs{Status: MapDone, InterFileNames: interFileNames, WorkerId: reply.WorkerId}
		slog.Debug("Map task done", "worker_id", reply.WorkerId, "task_id", reply.TaskId)
...
}
```
The work is very simple, read from the files assigned by coordinator (in this lab only 1 file per worker. However, I intense to make my design work in more common case). Then send the file content to mapf(), collecting the kvs, and write the kvs to intermediate files. After finish work, update the PRC args.
```go
func writeIntermediate(kvs []KeyValue, taskId int) []string {
	// Store all kvs in a map to avoid open the file repeatedly
	fileToContent := make(map[string]([]KeyValue))
	for _, kv := range kvs {
		reducerId := ihash(kv.Key) % nReduce
		filename := fmt.Sprintf("mr-%v-%v", taskId, reducerId)
		fileToContent[filename] = append(fileToContent[filename], kv)
	}
	interFileNames := []string{}
	for filename, kvs := range fileToContent {
		interFileNames = append(interFileNames, filename)
		fTemp, err := os.CreateTemp("", "mr-tmp-*")
		tempPath := fTemp.Name()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err, "in temp file create")
		}
		enc := json.NewEncoder(fTemp)
		if err := enc.Encode(kvs); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf(err.Error())
		}
		fTemp.Close()
		err = os.Rename(tempPath, fmt.Sprintf("/tmp/%v", filename))
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
	}
	return interFileNames
}
```
This is the writeIntermeadiate() function. I first iterate all kv in kvs, calculate the file name of witch the reducer should process later. Then store it in memory with a map. After that, I create all the temp files and store the kvs in corresponding files.

> [!note] Note
> The reason why I first store the kv and corresponding filename instead of write it immediately is to avoid frequent IO and complex logic

Then I go into the mr/coordinator. Finish the part of when should the Wait worker be assigned a map job. First I modify the Coordinator struct to record some necessary messages.
```go
type Coordinator struct {
	mu                sync.Mutex
	workerId          int // Fault tolerance
	allMapDone        bool // MapTask assign
	allReduceDone     bool // When to exit all workers
	interFileCnt      int // MapDone
	nReduce           int
	aliveWorker       int // Fault tolerance and when to exit
	taskId            int // Star from 0 in both map and reduce stage
	mapperCnt         int // MapTask
	reducerCnt        int // ReduceTask
	inputFile         []string
	intermediateFiles map[int][]string // MapDone and ReduceTask assign
	workerList        []WorkerEntry // Fault tolerance
	failTaskFiles     []Task // Fault tollerance
}
```
Not all the fields in Coordinator is used now. I mark the part of which they are really used. Then the assign part is as follows.
```go
...
case Wait:
	switch {
	// Map phase
	case !c.allMapDone && len(c.inputFile) > 0:
		slog.Debug("Assign map task", "task_id", c.taskId, "worker_id", worker.workerId)
		// Take the input file out
		fiilename := c.inputFile[0]
		c.inputFile = c.inputFile[1:]
		// Assign to worker
		worker = WorkerEntry{MapTask, worker.workerId, []string{fiilename}, getExpireTime(), c.taskId}
		c.replyAndSetWorkerList(&worker, reply)
		// Some state update
		c.mapperCnt++
		c.taskId++
	// No task to assign
	default:
	slog.Debug("No work, just wait")
	// Wait for all work done, some task fail, or all map done
	c.cond.Wait()
	// Reply to worker to start a new rpc
	worker.deadLine = getExpireTime()
	c.replyAndSetWorkerList(&worker, reply)
...
```
The expireTime and WorkerEntry will be discussed in the fault tolerance part. What the initial design do is just to assign a taskId and inputFile to worker. Then delete the corresponding inputFiles and increase the mapperCnt and taskId. If there no file to map, just wait. What to do next is deal with the finished job of mapper.
```go
...
case MapDone:
	slog.Debug("Map task done, store intermediate file locations", "worker_id", worker.workerId)
	// Store the intermediate files
	for _, filename := range args.InterFileNames {
		parts := strings.Split(filename, "-")
		reducerId, err := strconv.Atoi(parts[len(parts)-1])
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err, "in MapDone")
		}
		c.intermediateFiles[reducerId] = append(c.intermediateFiles[reducerId], filename)
	}
	slog.Debug("Stored intermediate file locations", "worker_id", worker.workerId)
	// Some state update
	c.mapperCnt--
	c.interFileCnt += len(args.InterFileNames)
	// All mappers done
	if c.mapperCnt == 0 && len(c.inputFile) == 0 && len(c.failTask) == 0 {
		slog.Debug("All map work done")
		c.allMapDone = true
		c.taskId = 0
	}
	// Reply
	worker = WorkerEntry{Wait, worker.workerId, nil, getExpireTime(), -1}
	c.replyAndSetWorkerList(&worker, reply)
...
```
First the mapperCnt-- and increase the interFileCnt. Then I collect the filename and store it into intermediaFiles with the reducerId mapping to it. This will be useful when assign the reduce job. Then I check if all map task done. If true, the allMapDone is marked to be true and the taskId is reassigned from 0.
## Reduce Task

The map part comes to a conclusion. Then I do the reduce part also starting from Worker().
```go
case ReduceTask:
	slog.Debug("Start reduce task", "worker_id", reply.WorkerId, "task_id", reply.TaskId)
	// Read files
	interFileNames := reply.Files
	reducerId := reply.TaskId
	kvs := readFromInterFiles(interFileNames)
	// Sort it
	sort.Sort(KVList(kvs))
	// Construct the args for reducef
	keyToAllValues := make(map[string][]string)
	for _, kv := range kvs {
		keyToAllValues[kv.Key] = append(keyToAllValues[kv.Key], kv.Value)
	}
	oFile, err := os.Create(fmt.Sprintf("mr-out-%v", reducerId))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Create file %v fail\n", oFile)
	}
	// Do the reducef
	for k, vs := range keyToAllValues {
		res := reducef(k, vs)
		fmt.Fprintf(oFile, "%v %v\n", k, res)
	}
	args = WorkerArgs{Status: ReduceDone, WorkerId: reply.WorkerId}
	slog.Debug("Reduce task done", "worker_id", reply.WorkerId, "task_id", reply.TaskId)
```
First I read files and reducerId from reply, and parse kvs from the interFileNames. Then I sort the kvs and combine all the values with the same key and send it to reducef to get the res to write in mr-out-reducerId. The readFromInterFiles and sort implement is as follows.
```go
type KVList []KeyValue

func (kv KVList) Len() int           { return len(kv) }
func (kv KVList) Swap(i, j int)      { kv[i], kv[j] = kv[j], kv[i] }
func (kv KVList) Less(i, j int) bool { return kv[i].Key < kv[i].Key }

func readFromInterFiles(interFileNames []string) (allkvs []KeyValue) {
	for _, filename := range interFileNames {
		f, err := os.Open(fmt.Sprintf("/tmp/%v", filename))
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err, "in readFromInterFiles")
		}
		var kvs []KeyValue
		dec := json.NewDecoder(f)
		if err = dec.Decode(&kvs); err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err, "in decode")
		}
		allkvs = append(allkvs, kvs...)
	}
	return
}
```
Very simple use of encoding/json and sort.Sort()
Then goes back to reducer assign in the mr/coordinator.go. The code is as follows.
```go
case Wait:
	case c.interFileCnt > 0 && c.allMapDone:
		slog.Debug("Assign reduce task", "task_id", c.taskId, "worker_id", worker.workerId)
		// Take the intermediate files out
		interFileNames := c.intermediateFiles[c.taskId]
		c.interFileCnt -= len(c.intermediateFiles[c.taskId])
		worker = WorkerEntry{ReduceTask, worker.workerId, interFileNames, getExpireTime(), c.taskId}
		c.replyAndSetWorkerList(&worker, reply)
		// Some state update
		c.taskId++
		c.reducerCnt++
```
We just simply send the interFileNames to corresponding worker and do some update to the fields in Coordinator. Then comes to the ReduceDone case:
```go
case ReduceDone:
	c.reducerCnt--
	if c.reducerCnt == 0 && c.interFileCnt == 0 && len(c.failTask) == 0 {
		c.allReduceDone = true
	}
	slog.Debug("Reduce task done", "worker_id", worker.workerId)
	// Reply
	worker = WorkerEntry{Wait, worker.workerId, nil, getExpireTime(), -1}
	c.replyAndSetWorkerList(&worker, reply)
default:
	return errors.New("invalid task status")
```
The logic is really simple, no need to explain.

## Terminate

After all reduce work done, the worker and coordinator should terminate. The logic in Worker() is simple. We just need to write a `os.Exit(0)` in `case Exit`. The main work is in the mr/coordinator.go.
```go
case Wait:
	case c.allReduceDone:
		slog.Debug("Kill worker")
		// All worker exit, clean the intermediate files
		if c.aliveWorker == 0 {
			slog.Debug("All worker killed, clean inter files")
			for _, filenames := range c.intermediateFiles {
				for _, filename := range filenames {
					os.Remove(fmt.Sprintf("/tmp/%v", filename))
				}
			}
			slog.Debug("All inter files cleaned, goodbye!")
		}
		// Tell the worker to exit
		worker.status = Exit
		c.replyAndSetWorkerList(&worker, reply)
		// State update
		c.aliveWorker--
```
Before all reduce work done, the worker should wait. When it is the time, we do c.aliveWorker-- and send an Exit to worker. Then clear all the intermediate files. The c.aliveWorker was increased when the worker first call Assign(). The code is as follows. We also do something for the fault tolerance at that time.
```go
func (c *Coordinator) Assign(args *WorkerArgs, reply *WorkerReply) error {
		c.mu.Lock()
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	worker := WorkerEntry{status: args.Status, workerId: args.WorkerId}
	// When the worker first do rpc, something should be initialized
	if args.IsFirstCall {
		worker.workerId = c.workerId
		worker.taskId = -1
		c.workerList = append(c.workerList, worker)
		c.workerId++
		c.aliveWorker++
	}
	// The worker now is marked dead
	if c.workerList[worker.workerId].status == Exit {
		worker = WorkerEntry{Exit, worker.workerId, nil, getExpireTime(), -1}
		c.replyAndSetWorkerList(&worker, reply)
		return nil
	}
	...
}
```
The struct WorkerEntry will be discussed in fault tolerance part. Here the logic is simple.
And we should also terminate the coordinator in Done() since the caller of coordinator periodically call the Done() function to check if the work is done.
```go
// main/mrcoordinator.go calls Done() periodically to find out
// if the entire job has finished.
func (c *Coordinator) Done() bool {
	c.mu.Lock()
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	if c.aliveWorker == 0 && c.allReduceDone {
		slog.Debug("Coordinator done")
		return true
	}
	return false
}
```

## Fault Tolerance

My design is to define two kinds of ids: workerId and taskId, a failTaskList, and the structure WorkerEntry and Task.
```go
// The task expire after 10 seconds from the time it was asigned
func getExpireTime() time.Time { return time.Now().Add(time.Second * 10) }

type WorkerEntry struct {
	status   Status
	workerId int
	files    []string
	deadLine time.Time
	taskId   int
}

type Task struct {
	taskId int
	status Status
	files  []string
}
```
When the worker first do RPC, it is assigned a workerId. And we make a new WorkerEntry and add it to c.workerList. When the coordinator wants to assign a map or reduce job to a worker, the taskId is assigned. There is also a function to periodically check if some worker is died. We run the function in MakeCoordinator()
```go
// Try to find if some worker is dead
func (c *Coordinator) checkWorkerStatus() {
	for {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		c.mu.Lock()
		for _, worker := range c.workerList {
			slog.Debug("Check worker", "worker", worker)
			if worker.status != Wait && time.Now().After(worker.deadLine) && worker.status != Exit {
				slog.Debug("Worker died", "worker_id", worker.workerId, "task_id", worker.taskId)
				// Add fail task to list
				c.failTask = append(c.failTask, Task{worker.taskId, worker.status, worker.files})
				c.workerList[worker.workerId].status = Exit
				c.aliveWorker--
				// Tell the waiting worker to have task
				c.cond.Broadcast()
			}
		}
		c.mu.Unlock()
	}
}

// create a Coordinator.
// main/mrcoordinator.go calls this function.
// nReduce is the number of reduce tasks to use.
func MakeCoordinator(sockname string, files []string, nReduce int) *Coordinator {
	c := Coordinator{
		inputFile:         files,
		nReduce:           nReduce,
		intermediateFiles: make(map[int][]string),
	}
	c.server(sockname)
	go c.checkWorkerStatus()
	slog.Debug("Create coordinator")
	return &c
}


```
Here is how it works: When a worker is died, the coordinator will notice that and make the status in c.workerList be Exit. Then add the files to c.failTaskList. And in `Wait case`, we check if there are some failed task and assign it to the worker.
```go
case Wait:
	// Some files has failed
	case len(c.failTask) > 0:
		// Take the task out
		task := c.failTask[0]
		c.failTask = c.failTask[1:]
		// Assign to worker
		slog.Debug("Continue failed task", "worker_id", worker.workerId, "task_id", task.taskId)
		worker = WorkerEntry{task.status, worker.workerId, task.files, getExpireTime(), task.taskId}
		c.replyAndSetWorkerList(&worker, reply)
```
The reason why we separate the taskId and workerId is because we should not generate two task's out put to one file. (e.g. If one reducer deals two tasks without this design, the second result will cover the first result since we generate the file mr-out-\* based on the taskId).
At last, here is the all-pass picture:

## Refine

After watch the [Lab1 Q&A]([Lecture 6 - Lab 1 Q&A_哔哩哔哩_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16f4y1z7kn?spm_id_from=333.788.videopod.episodes&vd_source=f9c8d8ef3c9c9806533b95189c09f7c9&p=6)), i do a little refinements to my code by using the sync.Cond.
My first design in Worker() when it receives a assignment to Wait, it just sleep for 50 milliseconds and do RPC again, which cause the increase of internet usage. So I use sync.Cond to Wait in the RCP call, and be waked up when needed (in allMapDone, some task failure, and allReduceDone). My refinement is as follows:
```go
/* ----In mr/worker.go---- */
func Worker(...) {
	...
	if reply.Status == Wait {
		// Delete the sleep
		args = WorkerArgs{Status: Wait, WorkerId: reply.WorkerId}
		continue
	}
}

/* ----In mr/coordinator.go---- */
type Coordinator struct {
	cond              *sync.Cond
	...
}

func (c *Coordinator) Assign(...) error {
	...
	switch worker.status {
	case Wait:
		switch {
		case len(c.failTaskFiles) > 0:
		...
		case !c.allMapDone && len(c.inputFile) > 0:
		...
		case c.interFileCnt > 0 && c.allMapDone:
		...
		case c.allReduceDone:
			c.cond.Broadcast()
			...
		default:
			c.cond.Wait()
			...
		}
	case MapDone:
		...
		c.cond.Broadcast()
		...
	case ReduceDone:
		...
	default:
		return errors.New("invalid task status")
	}
	return nil
}

func (c *Coordinator) checkWorkerStatus() {
	for {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		c.mu.Lock()
		for _, worker := range c.workerList {
			// Refine the logic
			if worker.status != Wait && time.Now().After(worker.deadLine) && worker.status != Exit {
				c.failTaskFiles = append(c.failTaskFiles, Task{worker.taskId, worker.status, worker.files})
				c.workerList[worker.workerId].status = Exit
				c.aliveWorker--
				c.cond.Broadcast()
			}
		}
		c.mu.Unlock()
	}
}

func MakeCoordinator(...) *Coordinator {
	...
	c.cond = sync.NewCond(&c.mu)
	...
}

```
